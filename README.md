# QR & Barcode Scanner

This script continuously captures video from the webcam, detects QR codes using pyzbar, extracts their data, writes the data along with a serial number to a text file, and displays the annotated video feed with QR code information. It's useful for applications involving QR code scanning and data logging from live video streams. Adjustments can be made to handle multiple QR codes simultaneously or to refine the annotation and data logging process further based on specific requirements.

Libraries used - Opencv, Numpy, pyzbar
